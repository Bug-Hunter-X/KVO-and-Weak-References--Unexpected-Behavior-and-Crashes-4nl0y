In Objective-C, a tricky bug can arise from the interaction between KVO (Key-Value Observing) and memory management, particularly when dealing with weak references.  If an object is deallocated while it's still being observed, accessing its properties through the observer can lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior. This is because the observed object's memory might have been freed, resulting in a dangling pointer.
